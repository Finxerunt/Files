ISL Permissions for Research:


Directions:
Write out a 500-word section on permissions for ISL Research. Look through Mahmoud’s example on what a permission section should contain. Not that this is permissions for software, we are doing permissions for research papers which is completely different. Just use this example to get an idea of what a Permission section should look like.
